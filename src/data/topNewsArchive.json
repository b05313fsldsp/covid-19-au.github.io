Statements made by the RBA governor, Philip Lowe, and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority chairman, Wayne Byres, about the risk of economic collapse when the jobkeeper program expires at the end of September will increase pressure on the Morrison government to defy a ginger group of Coalition backbenchers and extend stimulus into the new year."

      "summary": "A coalition of 62 countries has backed a joint Australian and European Union push for an independent inquiry into the coronavirus outbreak ahead of a crucial World Health Assembly (WHA) meeting tomorrow in Geneva. Australia was the first nation to call for an independent inquiry into how the coronavirus started. That drew furious condemnation from Beijing, which accused Australia of launching a political attack on China. But international support for the idea has been steadily growing. The Morrison Government has now swung its diplomatic firepower behind the European Union, which has also been pressing for an investigation while taking a more conciliatory line with Beijing."

The appeal, an annual fundraiser to support war veterans and their families, normally gathers more than 90 per cent of its funds via street sales of badges in the weeks leading up to Anzac Day. With volunteers unable to sell badges this year due to social distancing restrictions, RSL Victoria has raised about $100,000 in online donations. Before the coronavirus pandemic RSL Victoria was hoping to collect $3.5 million this year – the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II – having raised between $3 million and $3.5 million in previous years."
