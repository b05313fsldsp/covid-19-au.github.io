She selflessly suggested to her mother to buy toilet paper to help out people in their neighbourhood who may not have had the opportunity to buy it.</p><p>The best friends have gone around their neighbourhood handing out the toilet paper and tissues to those in pensioner cottages and those who are too unwell to go out. Their thoughtfulness and generosity has touched the hearts of many, especially the elderly who are very grateful for their actions.</p><p>The actions of Lucy and Addyson highlight that it is important to carry out acts of kindness and help those in need, rather than stock piling, which makes it more difficult for those who are vulnerable.

However, there has been a shortage of gowns, goggles, shields, and gloves, especially in the Bendigo area.</p><p>Doctors desperate for supplies have resorted to making their own gowns in order to continue to treat those in critical need.</p><p>Luckily, nearly 300 Bendigo locals and small businesses have volunteered to help fund, cut and sew homemade protective gowns for doctors to allow them to continue their life saving efforts.</p><p>A massive thank you to these selfless and generous individuals who are doing what they can to help health professionals to continue to treat their patients. You are a great example to how Australians can still unite and contribute to help combat the outbreak during self-isolation at home. Extraordinary work Australia!</p><p>If you know how to sew or would like to donate materials please contact gownsfordoctors@gmail.com!</p>",
